Project: AI Dermatology (Skin Scanner & Ingredient Analyzer)

Stack: React.js, Next.js, TensorFlow.js, Node.js, TypeScript


The goal is to ensure efficient execution of the AI
dermatology project through structured planning, effective
communication, and continuous progress tracking — transforming the
architecture into actionable tasks with measurable outcomes.
3. Strategic Leadership Goals
1. Vision Alignment: Ensure all team members understand the
product vision — AI-powered skin health analysis and ingredient
intelligence.
2. Agile Delivery: Organize development into short,
outcome-focused sprints.
3. Collaboration: Promote cross-functional teamwork between
frontend, backend, ML, and clinician advisors.
4. Accountability: Assign clear deliverables, timelines, and
success metrics.
5. Quality Assurance: Maintain technical excellence, testing
standards, and compliance with data privacy regulations.
6. Communication: Facilitate daily standups, weekly sprint
reviews, and retrospective meetings.


 Risk Management Plan
Risk

Mitigation Strategy
Model bias (skin tone diversity)
Build an inclusive dataset, clinician validation
Data privacy concerns
Encrypt data, GDPR compliance, and clear consent forms
ML inference delay
Optimize model, use GPU inference for heavy requests
Feature creep
Stick to MVP goals before adding new features
Lack of a dataset
Use public dermatology datasets (HAM10000, DermNet) initially





















This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
